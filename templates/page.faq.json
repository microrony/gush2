            "answer": "If you’re renovating your home, it is best to install the window films after all major renovation works are completed (i.e. hacking and drilling). Window films should be installed before any curtains, blinds or grille installation. This would be the ideal time as the site needs to be clean and dust-free for the best workmanship.\n\nIf you’re not renovating your home, any time is a good time. Just ensure the area is clean and easily accessible for installation."

It comes from a thermal spectrum that includes UV and infrared heat.\n\nOur window films block out heat across a larger range of this spectrum than traditional films. What’s more, Gush window films allow for more visible light to pass through. \n\nIn short, our films block more outside heat, and let more light in.

In a controlled test environment, our paints are generally touch dry in 1 - 2 hours. \n\nHowever, we do recommend waiting a day or two before applying the second and final coat. This is especially important on rainy days, where drying speeds are significantly slower and could cause cracking. \n\nGush Cair in particular is touch dry within 30 mins at room temperature of 30°C. For the second coating, a minimum of 1 hour of dry time is recommended. \n\nIn the long term, allow our paints to fully cure for 2 - 3 months before applying any external pressure on it. This ensures it lasts longer."
